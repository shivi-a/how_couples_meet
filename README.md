# How Couples Meet

Final Project for Gov 1005: Data

Shiny App found [HERE](https://shivi-a.shinyapps.io/how_couples_meet/)

Project Rationale
------
HCMST 2017 is intriguing as one of the few datasets from a comprehensive, representative survey of U.S. literate couples. 

Though the first "How Couples Meet and Stay Together" survey was conducted by Rosenfeld and his colleagues in 2009, this represents a completely new sample of individuals. The data was collected between July 13 and August 1, 2017, and just released in October of 2018. 

How individuals find a partner is a subject of near universal interest - particularly to a young college student witnessing committed relationships, hookups, and everything in between. 

With my visualizations, I sought to answer questions related to the different ways in which couples meet.
